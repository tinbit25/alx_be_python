# Define the principal, rate, and time
principal = 1000  # Principal amount in dollars
rate = 0.05       # Annual interest rate as a decimal (5%)
time = 3          # Time in years

# Calculate the simple interest using the formula: I = P * R * T
interest = principal * rate * time

# Print the calculated interest
